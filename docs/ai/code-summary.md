# Code summary — kerf

A directory map + reverse index ("where do I look for X?") for Claude Code sessions and other AI assistants. Keep this in sync with `src/` whenever a file is added, removed, or renamed.

## Directory tree

```
kerf/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts                  ← public entry — re-exports everything users import
│   ├── jsx-runtime.ts            ← JSX → SafeHtml string emitter
│   ├── jsx-types.ts              ← typed IntrinsicElements (KF-75) — per-tag attribute contracts, catches JSX typos at compile time
│   ├── reactive.ts               ← signal/computed/effect/batch (re-export) — `signal()` is dev-gated through `dev-signal.ts` when KF-176's opt-in env var is set; `effect()` is dev-gated through `dev-delegate-warn.ts` (KF-238) when its opt-in env var is set (wraps the body in enter/exit calls so `delegate()` can detect inside-effect callsites)
│   ├── dev-signal.ts             ← KF-176 — `DevSignal<T> extends Signal<T>` subclass that warns once on writes to signals with no subscribers (Rule 7 helper). Opt-in via `KERF_DEV_WARN_UNTRACKED_SIGNALS=1` in dev; production unchanged.
│   ├── dev-invariants.ts         ← KF-400 — opt-in structural audit of every list binding against the live DOM after each render (`KERF_DEV_INVARIANTS=1` warns, `=throw` throws; unset is a total no-op, no DOM walk). Checks marker liveness, marker-id agreement, row parentage/liveness/order, row aliasing across bindings, and region overlap between lists sharing a parent — each the negation of a defect that shipped. Reports a kerf bug, not an app pattern, which is why it is the one member of the family whose message says "please report it". Paired with the reconciler fuzz harness: the harness generates sequences, these checks notice one went wrong.
│   ├── dev-listener-warn.ts      ← KF-174 — opt-in dev `MutationObserver` + `addEventListener` prototype patch that warns when a node carrying an imperative listener is removed/rebuilt by the morph (Rule 4 helper). Opt-in via `KERF_DEV_WARN_REBUILT_LISTENERS=1` in dev; production unchanged.
│   ├── dev-store-warn.ts         ← KF-212 — opt-in dev warn when `defineStore.set(next)` has any key from the current state missing in `next` (Rule 8 partial-set helper). Per-store one-shot dedup; opt-in via `KERF_DEV_WARN_NARROW_SET=1` in dev; production unchanged.
│   ├── array-signal.ts           ← arraySignal (KF-92) — granular collection signal; lives at the kerfjs/array-signal subpath (KF-95) so non-users shed ~1 KB
│   ├── store.ts                  ← defineStore + resetAllStores + REGISTRY. Dev-only: `get()` returns a deep read-only Proxy (via `utils/devReadonly.ts`, gated by `utils/devMode.ts`); `set()` unwraps any get()-derived proxies with `toRaw` so the signal stores plain objects. Prod returns the bare reference.
│   ├── mount.ts                  ← mount() — segment-aware render bound to effect(); adopts an inert-document rootEl (defaultView === null) into the live document before first render (KF-243 defense-in-depth for the KF-240 WebKit inert-doc parse bug)
│   ├── morph.ts                  ← native general-purpose DOM reconciler (replaces morphdom); exported publicly as morph() (KF-150). Binding-marker aware: its child pairing steps past the wiring-inserted text node a `kfb:`/`kfbr:` marker owns (via bindings.ts `boundTextNodeOf`), so a bound hole mixed with static text siblings survives a morph (KF-374 — the static sibling used to be dropped). Two positional-lookahead recovery steps when a sibling shifts the cursor: 2.5 elements (KF-377 — a later same-tag unkeyed element is MOVED up, not cloned, so list containers/stateful elements survive a preceding removal), and 2.6 `kf-list:` markers (KF-382 — the marker is matched on exact data and moved WITH its row region, with captureFocus/restoreFocus around the move, so an each() binding never detaches and rows keep identity + caret). KF-385: the row region is `afterListRegion()` = marker through LAST owned row (interlopers between rows included, scan bounded by the next list's marker), used BOTH for the 2.6 run and for the cursor advance after a positional marker match — the old contiguous-owned-run reading let a single injected node shrink the region to the bare marker (run) or park the cursor inside the list (advance), either of which wedged a trailing template sibling in among the rows
│   ├── segment.ts                ← Segment types (static/list/mixed) + flatten helpers
│   ├── each.ts                   ← each() — keyed list iteration with per-item memo. KF-392: third arg is `cacheKey` OR an `EachOptions<T>` object `{ cacheKey?, key? }` (overloaded; the bare form still works). A `key` becomes the list id (namespaced `k:`) and does NOT consume the call-order counter, so keying a conditional list also stabilizes unkeyed siblings; duplicate keys in one render throw. `RenderContext.keysThisRender` (cleared by mount each render) enforces uniqueness. KF-388: a list's id is its call-order index, so `RenderContext.bindingSources` records which data source (arraySignal instance) each id last held; `eachGranular` compares identity FIRST and forces the snapshot route on a mismatch, so a queued patch can never be applied to another list's binding. The check lives here, not in the reconciler, because only each() can still emit the full item snapshot the rebuild needs (granular segments carry `items: []`).
│   ├── html.ts                   ← KF-333 — `html` tagged template at the kerfjs/html subpath (no-build authoring path for CDN/importmap consumers). Thin front-end over the exact JSX machinery: text holes via jsx-runtime's `_toSegment` (escaping, SafeHtml/each() list-segment passthrough, signal → bindText), attr holes via `_assertEmittableAttrName` + `bindAttr` (signals, grouped into one marker attr per element at the tag-close `>`) or `_renderAttrVerbatim` (statics — NO camelCase aliasing; authors write real HTML names). Parse-once-per-callsite via a WeakMap keyed on the template strings array; `_parseCount()` test hook. mount/morph/reconcilers unchanged.
│   ├── bindings.ts               ← KF-294 — fine-grained signal bindings. A `Signal` handed straight into a JSX attr (`class={sig}`) or text hole (`{sig}`) inside a mount() emits a marker instead of stringifying; a wiring pass attaches one effect per hole after parse so the node updates without a render re-run. TWO scopes with disjoint marker namespaces: GLOBAL holes (`data-kfb` / `<!--kfb:id-->`) wired by wireBindings() over the mount root; ROW holes inside each() (`data-kfbrow` / `<!--kfbr:id-->`, row-local ids) captured by captureRowBindings(), wired/disposed by BOTH reconcile paths at each row node's create/remove (snapshot: buildFreshNodes/removeOldNodes; granular: applyInsert/remove/update) — so select-row updates fire only the ~2 changed effects (no render, no reconcile). SSR/toString snapshots the value. Optimized wiring: root-attr holes resolved allocation-free (no querySelectorAll/Map for the common `<tr class={sig}>` row). KF-347: `carryOrRewireRowBindings` — the carry-vs-rewire decision for rows whose node survives an in-place update (granular reuseBound + inplace updateRowInPlace, incl. the html-identical no-op arms): same signal instances per hole → carry for free; any changed instance → dispose + re-wire against the surviving node, so self-reading holes update after arraySignal.update(); text-hole wiring reuses the marker's inserted text node (WeakMap) so a rewire never stacks a duplicate. RESERVED NAMESPACE (KF-314): the wiring pass matches markers by id across the subtree with no ownership check, so `data-kfb`/`data-kfbrow` + comments beginning `kfb:`/`kfbr:`/`kf-list:` are a reserved consumer contract — a consumer that emits one can collide with a real binding's id and steal its effect; documented in docs/2-reactivity.md and pinned by a marker-constant test. SECURITY (KF-322 completes KF-306): the bound path's attr NAME is trusted at write time — `on*` and malformed attribute names are rejected at binding registration in jsx-runtime's `jsx()` signal branch via the shared `assertEmittableAttrName` (the same helper renderAttr uses for static attrs), so a signal bound to `onclick` can never reach `setBoundAttr`→`setAttribute('onclick', …)` and install a live inline handler.
│   ├── list-render-state.ts      ← KF-336 reified dispatch state machine — ListRenderState (unbound/empty/bound), deriveListRenderState(count), decideListPath() with the documented transition table (first-render/empty-binding/no-patches/replace/count-drift → snapshot; else granular; cachekey-drift + render-threw layered on in each.ts). Pure + directly unit-tested, incl. the previously-c8-ignored count-drift arm
│   ├── list-reconcile.ts         ← top-level dispatcher (KF-112) — re-exports BoundItem / ListBinding / endAnchor and defines reconcileList; its non-empty-binding granular precondition is the DOM-side restatement of list-render-state's `bound` state
│   ├── list-binding.ts           ← BoundItem / ListBinding shape + endAnchor() (KF-116) — extracted to break the circular import between list-reconcile.ts and its sibling reconcilers
│   ├── list-reconcile-snapshot.ts ← snapshot reconcile path (classify / bulk-parse / LIS / move)
│   ├── utils/rowContract.ts       ← KF-103 "exactly one top-level element per row" helpers + KF-389 namespace-aware row parsing: `parseRowTemplate(html, parent?)` returns a DocumentFragment parsed in the list parent's namespace (SVG rows re-enter foreign content via an `<svg>` wrapper, the same route first render takes; `<foreignObject>` children stay HTML). Every reconcile path that creates a row node threads its `liveParent` through.
│   ├── list-reconcile-inplace.ts ← snapshot fast path: when refs are unchanged in order, morph changed rows in place (reusing the granular surgical/morph ladder) instead of node-replacing them — avoids table relayout for external-state-driven row changes
│   ├── list-reconcile-granular.ts ← granular reconcile path (KF-92 patch-driven, KF-93/94 bulk parse)
│   ├── list-reconcile-fast-paths.ts ← KF-198 attribute-only + KF-206 text-content-only fast paths for the granular update path. KF-390: the attribute-only path is the THIRD attribute writer (with morph.ts and bindings.ts) and now calls `syncFormProp` at both its set and remove sites, so a controlled checked/value on a row's top-level element can't go stale just because the diff took the fast route.
│   ├── list-reconcile-focus.ts   ← focus snapshot/restore around the move pass (engine-quirk fix); also reused by morph.ts's 2.6 marker-run move (KF-382), since that move can carry a focused row too
│   ├── attrSelector.ts           ← attr / AttrSpec<N,V> — two overloads: static attr(name,value)→AttrSpec (with .attrs spreadable JSX object), dynamic attr(name)→factory; cssEscapeIdent + escapeCSSString internals
│   ├── delegate.ts               ← delegate<T> + delegateCapture<T> (generic element type for handler arg) + DelegateOptions; BOTH helpers default to closest()-style walk-up matching and pass the matched ancestor — delegateCapture unified onto closest() (BREAKING; opt into old direct-match via { match: 'direct' }); shared makeListener() applies match mode + rootEl.contains() guard; calls warnIfInsideEffect() at the top of both helpers when KF-238's gate is on
│   ├── dev-delegate-warn.ts      ← KF-238 — opt-in dev warn when `delegate()` / `delegateCapture()` is called inside an `effect()` body (each effect re-run installs a fresh listener; effect disposer cleans only the subscription). `reactive.ts`'s `effect()` wrap increments/decrements a depth counter when the gate is on; `delegate.ts` checks it. Opt-in via `KERF_DEV_WARN_DELEGATE_IN_EFFECT=1` in dev; production unchanged.
│   ├── dev-each-warn.ts          ← KERF_DEV_WARN_DUPLICATE_EACH_KEYS + KERF_DEV_WARN_EACH_IN_MORPH_SKIP opt-in warnings
│   ├── dev-list-key-warn.ts      ← KF-392 — ALWAYS-ON dev warn (no env var, like the missing-row-key warning) when an unkeyed each() list's call-order id is taken over by a different list, so its rows were rebuilt (DOM identity/focus/scroll/IME lost, O(rows)). Names `each(…, { key })` as the fix, incl. that keying the CONDITIONAL list is usually enough. One-shot per list id; blind to shifts between two each() over the SAME arraySignal (keys close that by construction).
│   ├── dev-list-rebind-warn.ts   ← KF-379 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_LIST_REBIND=1` warning fired from mount's self-heal branch when a rebuilt each() container (ancestor tag swap) is re-bound: rows repopulate correctly but their DOM state (focus/scroll/IME/imperative listeners) is discarded. One-shot per list id.
│   ├── dev-rerender-warn.ts      ← KF-345 — opt-in dev warn (`KERF_DEV_WARN_VALUE_ONLY_RERENDER=1`) when a surrounds-CHANGED re-render's diff is confined to text/attr values (lockstep template-parse tree compare; conservative — any shape/comment change bails structural): every changed hole could be a fine-grained binding. One-shot per mount (per-mount ctx from `mount()`); parse runs only when opted in, on the already-slow changed path.
│   ├── dev-binding-warn.ts       ← KF-338 — opt-in dev warn when a fine-grained GLOBAL binding switches signal instance on `mount()`'s byte-equal-surrounds fast path (`class={cond ? sigA : sigB}`): the effect isn't re-wired so the hole silently goes stale. `mount()` retains the wired binding list (gated on the opt-in) and calls `maybeWarnStaleBinding` on the fast path; per-hole one-shot dedup. Opt-in via `KERF_DEV_WARN_STALE_BINDING=1` in dev; production unchanged.
│   ├── toElement.ts              ← SVG-aware JSX-to-DOM; adopts the result into the live `document` (KF-240) so inert-template/DOMParser-document nodes aren't returned (WebKit mis-parses innerHTML on inert-doc elements under bursts)
│   └── utils/
│       ├── devMode.ts            ← KF-334 shared dev-mode gate `isDevMode()`. Precedence: `globalThis.KERF_DEV` boolean override (read lazily, wins) → else `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. Routes every dev-only path (store get() read-only guard, rowContract row-key warn, the KERF_DEV_WARN_* opt-in family). Lets no-bundler/CDN consumers (no `process`) opt out of dev-ON with `globalThis.KERF_DEV = false` before mount; keeps the NODE_ENV branch so bundlers still DCE dev paths.
│       ├── devReadonly.ts        ← KF-341 dev-only deep read-only Proxy for defineStore's `get()` snapshot. `devReadonlyProxy(obj)` throws a Rule-8 `TypeError` on set/delete/defineProperty and lazily wraps nested plain objects/arrays (deep, O(1)/access, no clone); reads (spread/JSON/keys/iteration/instanceof) are transparent. `toRaw(value)` deep-unwraps (structural-sharing) so a `set({ ...get() })`-derived object is stored plain — the internal signal never holds a Proxy. Never freezes the live object.
│       ├── escapeHtml.ts         ← used by jsx-runtime
│       ├── jsx-attr-aliases.ts   ← camelCase → HTML/SVG attribute name table (KF-21)
│       ├── rowContract.ts        ← KF-103 row-contract helpers — ROW_HTML_SNIPPET_MAX, parseRowTemplate, parseSingleRow, collectTemplateChildren, rowContractError, truncateRowHtml (dev-mode row-key warn gated via utils/devMode.ts). parseSingleRow/collectTemplateChildren are the shared single-row-parse + template-children-capture helpers deduped out of the granular/in-place reconcilers
│       ├── syncFormProp.ts       ← KF-335 form-state property sync (checked/value/selected follow a MUTATED attribute; dirty-flag detachment fix) — called by morph.ts's morphAttributes and bindings.ts's setBoundAttr only at actual attribute mutation, so uncontrolled usage stays untouched; focused elements keep the in-progress edit
│       ├── templateParse.ts      ← KF-333 — static-parts state machine for `html\`\`` (text/tag/comment modes + quote state). Classifies each hole as text or complete-attribute-value; tag-name / attr-name / partial-value / in-comment holes THROW with actionable messages; records per-chunk tag-close offsets for bound-attr marker injection
│       └── urlScreen.ts          ← KF-297 shared URL-attr screening (isDangerousUrlValue / dangerousUrlWarning / reportDangerousUrl) used by BOTH jsx-runtime's renderAttr (static attrs) and bindings' setBoundAttr (bound attrs) — scheme-based: drops javascript:/vbscript: + script-executing data: subtypes (text/html, image/svg+xml, xml; inert media allowlisted) on href/src/formaction/action/xlink:href/data(<object>); normalizes control-char/whitespace scheme obfuscation before matching; raw() opts out. KF-340: reportDangerousUrl THROWS in dev (isDevMode()), console.warns + drops in prod (byte-identical) — the drop happens in both modes, only the reporting differs
├── tests/
│   ├── conventions.test.ts       ← KF-286 — API-surface + no-default-export + row-contract invariants (the in-suite complement to check-doc-api-coverage.mjs / check-feature-coverage.mjs); pins facts line coverage can't express
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── array-signal.test.ts
│   │   ├── audit-gap-coverage.test.tsx     ← regression-net for v8-only branches found via coverage gaps
│   │   ├── delegate.test.ts
│   │   ├── attr.test.ts
│   │   ├── dev-delegate-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-238 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_DELEGATE_IN_EFFECT=1` dev-mode warning when `delegate()` / `delegateCapture()` is called inside an `effect()` body; covers depth tracking, throw-still-decrements, env-var gate off, production-mode short-circuit, nested effects, one-shot dedup. `.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── dev-each-warn.internal.test.ts ← opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_EACH_IN_MORPH_SKIP=1` (each() inside data-morph-skip) and `KERF_DEV_WARN_DUPLICATE_EACH_KEYS=1` (duplicate cacheKey values) warnings; covers env-var gates, dedup, production-mode short-circuit.
│   │   ├── dev-list-rebind-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-379 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_LIST_REBIND=1` rebuilt-container warning: default-off, fires-once-through-mount (ancestor tag swap → self-heal), per-list-id dedup across a swap-back, production-mode silence, direct-call dedup. `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── dev-binding-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-338 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_STALE_BINDING=1` dev-mode warning when a fine-grained binding switches signal instance on the byte-equal-surrounds fast path; covers attr + text holes, same-instance no-warn, env-var gate off, production short-circuit, per-hole one-shot dedup, and wiring-path retention across a surrounds-changed render. `.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── dev-listener-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-174 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_REBUILT_LISTENERS=1` dev-mode MutationObserver-based warning when a node carrying an imperative `addEventListener` listener is removed/rebuilt by the morph; covers the env-var gates, the descendant walk, and the helper-level rowContract `maybeWarnMissingRowKey` branches. `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it (the test imports the `_resetWarnedForTests` helper which is not in the public dist barrel).
│   │   ├── dev-store-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-212 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_NARROW_SET=1` dev-mode warning when `defineStore.set(next)` has any key from the current state missing in `next`; covers opt-out (env var unset / =0 / production), opt-in (warns once, names missing keys), per-store dedup, same-count-different-keys, array-skip, null-skip, primitive-skip, the `_resetWarnContext` test helper, and (KF-334) that a `globalThis.KERF_DEV` override gates the warning both ways. `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── devMode.internal.test.ts ← KF-334 — the shared `isDevMode()` gate: NODE_ENV default (test/dev true, production false, no-`process` CDN consumer true), `globalThis.KERF_DEV` boolean override precedence (false forces prod, true forces dev, non-boolean ignored), and the laziness contract (override read at call time, not memoized at import). `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── bindings.internal.test.ts ← KF-347 direct coverage of carryOrRewireRowBindings' argument-shape matrix (both-undefined carry, defensive undefined arms, exact carry-through of the disposer array). `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── dev-rerender-warn.internal.test.ts ← KF-345 — opt-in `KERF_DEV_WARN_VALUE_ONLY_RERENDER=1` value-only re-render warning: gate matrix (default-off, KERF_DEV override), end-to-end mount wiring (text/attr/boolean-attr value changes warn; structural + mixed changes stay silent), per-mount one-shot dedup, independent mounts, and the `_isValueOnlyDiff` branch matrix. `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── devReadonly.internal.test.ts ← KF-341 dev deep read-only guard helpers: `devReadonlyProxy` wraps null-proto/nested objects + is idempotent/identity-stable; `toRaw` passes primitives/exotics through, unwraps a proxy to its raw, and deep-unwraps a spread-built object preserving structural sharing. `*.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it.
│   │   ├── demo-configs.test.ts ← guards the animated demo-capture configs + committed SVGs under site/scripts/demo-captures/ + site/public/demos/: every frame must use an explicit `cut` or `magic-move` transition (never domotion's silent crossfade default — the full-screen flash), every committed SVG must keep `step-end` on its fv-N opacity tracks (no last-frame fade-out; domotion ≥ 0.18.0 emits `step-end` natively through SVGO, so the old fix-cut-timing post-pass is gone), and — KF-330 follow-up: a config shipped without running its capture 404'd on the site — every config's `output` SVG must be committed, every committed SVG must have a config (no orphans), and every `/demos/*.svg` reference in site/src must resolve to a committed file
│   │   ├── dist-full-config.test.ts ← KF-344 — unit-tests the `srcToDistPlugin` resolver from `vitest.config.dist-full.ts`: pins that a top-level `src/utils/*` (plus bare `utils` and nested `.../utils/*`) import throws the loud "refused to remap private helper" error, and that non-source imports pass through. Guards against the regressed `.includes('/utils/')` check that never matched the leading-slash-free, `src/`-relative `moduleName`.
│   │   ├── diagnostic-error-audit.test.tsx ← KF-169 — one test per Hard Rule pinning the runtime behavior callers see on violation (introduced when the `/ai-evidence/diagnostics/` page existed; that page was removed in KF-211 but the runtime contract these tests pin still matters as a UX gate)
│   │   ├── form-state-sync.internal.test.ts ← KF-335 direct unit tests for the private syncFormProp helper (internal → excluded from dist-full)
│   │   ├── list-render-state.internal.test.ts ← KF-336 direct coverage of the reified dispatch state machine's transition table, incl. the count-drift arm unreachable through mount()
│   │   ├── form-state-sync.test.ts ← KF-335 public-surface coverage for the morph/binding form-prop sync call sites (diverged-property simulation; the truthful dirty-flag behavior is browser-tested)
│   │   ├── morph.internal.test.ts
│   │   ├── doc-contract-coverage.test.tsx  ← KF-104 — comprehensive contract suite covering every doc-asserted behavior
│   │   ├── bindings.test.ts
│   │   ├── each.test.ts
│   │   ├── edge-case-coverage.test.tsx     ← adversarial probes for mount-lifecycle / shape-transitions / focus-on-granular-path / fast-path corners / 1000-row stress
│   │   ├── html.test.ts ← KF-333 — `kerfjs/html` tagged template: JSX semantic parity (text + attr holes), hole-contract errors, fine-grained signal bindings under mount, each() composition (snapshot + granular), SSR snapshots, parse cache
│   │   ├── jsx-runtime.test.ts
│   │   ├── jsx-types.test.tsx
│   │   ├── kf102-each-after-transition.test.tsx ← KF-102 round 2 — each() reconcile after sibling-introduction transitions
│   │   ├── kf377-conditional-sibling-before-each.test.tsx ← KF-377 — removing a conditional sibling before a keyed list must not empty it: morph positional-lookahead preservation (direct/nested shapes, '' + null branches, trailing conditional, arraySignal granular-after-toggle) + the stale-binding self-heal on a container rebuild
│   │   ├── kf384-morph-preserve-interaction.test.tsx ← KF-384 — `data-morph-preserve` (consumer-owned) nodes interleaved with each()-owned rows across a positional shift; the two node classes are both protected from the trailing-removal pass but by different mechanisms/owners. Found two defects, pinned asserting CURRENT behavior with KNOWN BUG comments: KF-385 (a non-owned node between marker and rows truncates the KF-382 run collector → trailing sibling wedges ahead of the rows) and KF-386 (a preserved node is destroyed with a rebuilt container — silent, permanent, since nothing re-creates consumer-owned nodes). Also pins the KF-383 container-key workaround protecting against KF-386.
│   │   ├── kf389-svg-row-namespace.test.tsx ← KF-389 — each() rows inside an <svg> root keep the SVG namespace on EVERY parse (granular single + bulk insert, snapshot append, structural replaceChild, nested SVG), with the <foreignObject>-children-are-HTML carve-out and an HTML control; plus the row contract firing on both the first-render and granular parse paths.
│   │   ├── kf392-list-key.test.tsx ← KF-392 — each({ key }) stable list identity: identity+focus across a sibling toggle both directions, an UNKEYED control proving the key does the work, keying the conditional list stabilizing its unkeyed sibling, the same-arraySignal hole closed, granular fast path retained, duplicate-key throw, per-render (not once-ever) key scope, and both legacy + options cacheKey forms.
│   │   ├── dev-list-key-warn.internal.test.tsx ← KF-392 — the always-on identity-shift warning: fires on a real shift, one-shot per list, silent for keyed lists, silent for ordinary renders, silent in production mode.
│   │   ├── kf393-new-code-audit.test.tsx ← KF-393 — third adversarial sweep over the KF-385…KF-392 fix cadence + the new each() options API: options-API edges (empty options/key, `k:` namespacing vs call-order ids, hidden-mutation reappearance, later-render duplicate-key throw + recovery, branch-swap identity, options mutation, SSR/`html`/multi-mount), whole-morph focus-wrap edges, keyed row-region moves, adjacent/empty-list bounds, replace()→granular. KNOWN BUG pins: KF-394 (identity-shift warning false-positives on legitimate source swaps + module-level dedup), KF-395 (`-->` in a list key injects live markup + internal TypeError), KF-396 (row-structure tag check falsely rejects SVG rows on serialization mismatch), KF-397 (text-content fast path skips textarea `.value` sync — route-dependent staleness). Analysis: docs/ai/test-gap-analysis-kf393.md
│   │   ├── kf391-table-row-structure.test.tsx ← KF-391 — row markup the HTML parser RESTRUCTURES (each() of <tr> directly under <table>, where an implicit tbody wraps the run) now throws a row-structure error naming both tags instead of misbinding + duplicating rows; the supported explicit-<tbody> shape is pinned alongside, including that it does NOT fire the missing-row-key warning.
│   │   ├── kf388-list-identity.test.tsx ← KF-388 — a queued arraySignal patch never reaches another list's binding when a conditional each() shifts call-order ids: insert/update/remove/move flavors, both toggle directions, repeated toggles, and proof the ordinary granular fast path is untouched.
│   │   ├── kf380-interaction-matrix.test.tsx ← KF-380 — the morph × fine-grained-binding × owned-row interaction matrix, tested adversarially (multi-slot lookahead shifts, conditional siblings around holes AND lists, container tag swaps, self-heal → granular, empty ↔ morph-move ↔ refill, long cross-state walks). Also the KF-381/KF-382 regression home: a conditional sibling that shares/shadows the list container used to strand + duplicate owned rows (KF-381 — the self-heal now removes still-live stranded rows before repopulating), and shifting the marker used to cost rows their identity (KF-382 — the marker + owned-row run now move as a unit; identity, focus, and no-wedge-by-a-trailing-sibling are asserted). Analysis: docs/ai/test-gap-analysis-kf380.md
│   │   ├── kf387-html-seam.test.tsx ← KF-387 — the `html` tagged template × morph × bindings × owned-row seam: replays every KF-374/KF-377/KF-381/KF-382 bug shape through `html` templates only (round-trip, both toggle directions) to pin the "identical runtime paths" claim structurally. Load-bearing verified against pre-KF-377 and pre-KF-382 code. Analysis: docs/ai/test-gap-analysis-kf387.md
│   │   ├── kf387-seam-sweep.test.tsx ← KF-387 — the second adversarial sweep's cross-seam probes: delegate × morph replacement/move, bindings × data-morph-skip, stale-binding re-wire on a changed-surrounds render, form-state sync × list reconcile (morph route asserting + KNOWN BUG KF-390 fast-path pins), SVG × list reconcile (surrounds asserting + KNOWN BUG KF-389 namespace pins), each() list identity across a varying call count (KNOWN BUG KF-388 pins incl. the wrong-list granular-patch corruption), and each() × table parsing (explicit-tbody asserting + KNOWN BUG KF-391 implicit-tbody pin)
│   │   ├── list-reconcile-inplace.test.ts ← snapshot in-place content-update fast path: same-refs-in-order updates morph in place (node identity preserved, no parse) vs replaceChild on tag change; bail cases (length change, reorder, empty/clear, moved+changed) and the row-contract throw
│   │   ├── list-reconcile-fast-paths.test.ts ← KF-198 + KF-206 — attribute-only + text-content-only fast paths in the granular update path; firing/bailing cases and parse-count assertions (public-API tests via mount/arraySignal)
│   │   ├── list-reconcile-fast-paths.internal.test.ts ← direct-function bail-branch coverage for the same fast paths; calls the non-public helpers with crafted HTML; `.internal.test.ts` so dist-full excludes it
│   │   ├── dev-invariants.internal.test.ts ← KF-400 — the opt-in structural invariant checks (`KERF_DEV_INVARIANTS=1` warn / `=throw` throw). Each case corrupts a binding the way a real defect did — marker gone from the root, id carried by a different marker node, rows detached / attached elsewhere / out of order / crossing their own marker, a row claimed by two bindings, two lists' regions overlapping in one parent — and asserts the checker names it; plus the mode matrix (unset, unrecognized value, warn, throw, production off). kerf's own suites run it in throw mode via `vitest.config*.ts`.
│   │   ├── kf408-keyed-template-pairing.test.tsx ← KF-407/408/409 — the morph's positional pairing must not repurpose a node that is something else. It only required the LIVE node to be unkeyed, so a reappearing conditional element could be paired with any same-tag neighbour — and then each rule that protects a node's contents kept the WRONG contents alive in the repurposed host: `data-morph-skip` swallowed the element and duplicated the widget (a second live library instance), `data-morph-preserve` left its child under a foreign host, a binding marker's inserted text node leaked a bound hole's text. Three symmetries now gate it — key, `data-morph-skip`, and marker kind (`kf-list:` vs `kfb:`/`kfbr:`) — the last two needing nothing from the author, so the unkeyed variants are covered too. Also pins the two behaviors the fix must not disturb: the unkeyed positional lookahead and keyed reorder.
│   │   ├── kf403-list-identity-shift.test.tsx ← KF-403 — an identity shift (an unkeyed list's call-order id taken over by a different list) costs a REBUILD, never correctness. Two structures were being read as the arriving list's own: the per-item HTML memo (two lists over one source hit it identically, so the wrong row markup was emitted — invisible to the source guard, since a shared source is identical by construction) and the live `ListBinding` (reused whenever *a* marker with that id was in the tree rather than the same marker NODE, so rows landed in the previous occupant's container). Covers both toggle directions, repeated toggles, a shift batched with a source mutation, keyed lists being untouched by the reset, and that a steady-state render still runs exactly one pass.
│   │   ├── kf402-list-end-anchor.test.tsx ← KF-402 / KF-404 — a list's end anchor is the node right after its last row, of ANY node type. `endAnchor()` used `nextElementSibling`, which walked past the two things most likely to sit there: static content after the list (so an inserted row jumped a trailing footer) and the next sibling list's `kf-list` marker (so rows crossed into the neighboring list's region, and two lists that both started empty rendered in REVERSED order). Covers both reconcile paths, text + element siblings, siblings before and after the list, marker/row adjacency across a re-render, and three interleaved sibling lists. Found by the fuzz harness's differential invariant.
│   │   ├── reconciler-fuzz.test.ts ← KF-399 — property-based (fuzz) testing of the whole render pipeline, the answer to "the hand-directed sweeps are steered by the same priors that wrote the code". Generates random-but-valid trees (nested elements, keyed/unkeyed lists, conditionals wrapping and preceding lists, two lists over one source, global + row-scope holes, `<svg>` subtrees, `data-morph-skip` islands) and walks them through random mutation sequences, checking invariants after EVERY step; shrinks a failure to a minimal paste-ready case. Strongest invariant is differential: incremental reconcile must equal a from-scratch render of the same state. Hand-rolled rather than `fast-check` (a generic library's arbitraries + shrinker would both have to be replaced anyway; see the file header). Found and retired six defects on its first day: KF-402 (sibling lists render in the wrong order), KF-404 (a row jumps a trailing static sibling), KF-403 (an identity shift renders another list's rows), and — once soaked alongside the KF-400 invariant checks — KF-407/408/409 (a keyed template element positionally repurposing an unkeyed neighbour). Runs with NO quarantine today; every generated case is expected to hold. When a future defect isn't fixed in the same change, re-introduce the pattern: scope entries by the shape of the case, pin a reproduction that must keep failing, budget the excused fraction. Knobs: `KERF_FUZZ_RUNS`, `KERF_FUZZ_SEED`, `KERF_FUZZ_DIFF=0`. Long soaks go through `scripts/fuzz-soak.mjs` (`npm run fuzz:soak`), which windows seeds across FRESH PROCESSES: one process caps out at 6–15k cases because happy-dom retains detached DOM trees (~1.5 MB per mount cycle, measured with no kerf involved; kerf's own mount/dispose is leak-free over 22k cycles).

## Public exports

Every export reachable via `import { ... } from 'kerfjs'`:

| Export | From | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signal` | `reactive.ts` | Create a reactive value |
| `computed` | `reactive.ts` | Derive a read-only signal |
| `effect` | `reactive.ts` | Run on signal change |
| `batch` | `reactive.ts` | Coalesce multiple writes |
| `Signal<T>` | `reactive.ts` | Type |
| `ReadonlySignal<T>` | `reactive.ts` | Type |
| `defineStore` | `store.ts` | Composable store factory |
| `resetAllStores` | `store.ts` | Reset every registered store |
| `Store<TState, TActions>` | `store.ts` | Type |
| `mount` | `mount.ts` | Render JSX into a DOM element via kerf's segment-aware diff |
| `MountResult` | `mount.ts` | Type — what `mount()`'s render function can return (`SafeHtml \| string \| number \| boolean \| null \| undefined`, KF-119) |
| `morph` | `morph.ts` | KF-150 — one-shot in-place DOM reconciliation; same algorithm `mount()` uses, but doesn't subscribe to signals |
| `each` | `each.ts` | Keyed list iteration; per-item HTML memo by object identity (+ optional key) |
| `attr`, `AttrSpec<N,V>` | `attrSelector.ts` | Two overloads. **Static** `attr(name, value)` → `AttrSpec<N,V>` with `.name`, `.value`, `.selector`, `.attrs` (`{ readonly [name]: value }` — spreadable into JSX). **Dynamic** `attr<N,V=string>(name)` → factory `(value: V) => { readonly [name]: V }` for per-row data attributes; `V` defaults to `string`, specify both generics to constrain the value set. Both CSS-escape at creation time. |
| `delegate<T>` | `delegate.ts` | Event delegation; auto-promotes known non-bubblers (focus/blur/scroll/load/error/mouseenter/mouseleave) to capture, keeps `closest()` matching; generic `T extends Element` narrows the `target` arg; optional `{ match: 'closest' \| 'direct' }` (default `'closest'`) |
| `delegateCapture<T>` | `delegate.ts` | Explicit-capture escape hatch; `closest()`-style walk-up matching by default (unified with `delegate()`), passes the matched ancestor; same `T` generic; opt into strict `matches()` via `{ match: 'direct' }` |
| `DelegateOptions` | `delegate.ts` | Options for both delegation helpers: `{ match?: 'closest' \| 'direct' }` — `'closest'` (default) walks up via `closest()`, `'direct'` matches only `event.target` |
| `toElement` | `toElement.ts` | JSX → DOM (SVG-aware) |
| `SafeHtml` | `jsx-runtime.ts` | The JSX result type |
| `isSafeHtml` | `jsx-runtime.ts` | Cross-bundle type guard for `SafeHtml` (preferred over `instanceof`) |
| `raw` | `jsx-runtime.ts` | Wrap a pre-escaped HTML string |
| `Fragment` | `jsx-runtime.ts` | JSX `<>...</>` tag; also re-exported from the barrel for manual composition |

Plus, on the `kerfjs/html` subpath: `html` (tagged template — same runtime semantics as JSX, no build step; `HtmlValue` hole type; `_parseCount()` test hook), see `html.ts` above.

Plus, on the `kerfjs/array-signal` subpath:

| Export | From | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `arraySignal` | `array-signal.ts` | Factory for `ArraySignal<T>` — granular collection signal emitting typed patches |
| `ArraySignal<T>` | `array-signal.ts` | Class (and type) — `update`/`insert`/`push`/`remove`/`move`/`replace` mutators + `value` snapshot read |
| `ArrayPatch<T>` | `array-signal.ts` | Type — patch event shape (`update`/`insert`/`remove`/`move`/`replace`) |
| `ARRAY_SIGNAL_BRAND` | `array-signal.ts` | The `Symbol.for('kerfjs.ArraySignal')` brand symbol — exported so consumers that build their own collection types can opt into the brand and have `each()` recognize them |

The class is detected via `Symbol.for('kerfjs.ArraySignal')` (KF-95), not `instanceof`, so multiple bundle copies still interoperate. The `each()` runtime in the main barrel uses the brand to detect `arraySignal` arguments without importing the class.

Plus, on the `kerfjs/testing` subpath:

| Export | From | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clearStoreRegistry` | `store.ts` (re-exported via `testing.ts`) | Drop every registered store. Test-only — lets a unit-test file reset `defineStore`'s module-level `REGISTRY` between cases without re-importing the store modules. |

Plus, on the `kerfjs/jsx-runtime` subpath (re-exported types for declaration merging — KF-100):

| Export | From | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KerfBaseAttrs` | `jsx-types.ts` | Shared attribute base for every typed element |
| `KerfCustomElement` | `jsx-types.ts` | Loose attribute set for custom elements / web components |
| `AttrLike<T>` / `AttrValue` / `DataAriaAttrs` | `jsx-types.ts` | Building blocks for project-specific intrinsic-element types |

The JSX runtime is a separate subpath export at `kerfjs/jsx-runtime`. It's referenced by tsconfig (`"jsxImportSource": "kerfjs"`); users do not import from it directly *unless* they're declaration-merging custom-element types into `JSX.IntrinsicElements` (see `docs/8-api-reference.md` §8.5).

## Build outputs

`npm run build` → `tsup` → `dist/`. TypeScript is dual-track (KF-375): the native **TypeScript 7** compiler — installed as the `typescript7` npm alias, invoked as `node node_modules/typescript7/bin/tsc` — runs every typecheck gate (`npm run typecheck` and the three `-p` dist-typing gates plus the docs-examples compile), while `typescript@6` (the JS-API bridge; native 7 ships no JS API) remains the resolvable `typescript` package for tsup's `.d.ts` emit and typescript-eslint (whose peer range caps at `<6.1.0`). `tsup.config.ts` sets `dts.compilerOptions.ignoreDeprecations: '6.0'` because tsup hardcodes the TS-7-removed `baseUrl` into its dts build — the waiver lives there, not in tsconfig.json.

Outputs:

- `dist/index.js` (ESM bundle, ~11 KB min+gz including `@preact/signals-core`; ~12 KB if a consumer also imports `arraySignal` from `kerfjs/array-signal`. See `bench/results.md` for the per-shape numbers.)
- `dist/index.d.ts` (types)
- `dist/jsx-runtime.js`
- `dist/jsx-runtime.d.ts`
- `dist/array-signal.js` (`kerfjs/array-signal` subpath, KF-95)
- `dist/array-signal.d.ts`
- `dist/html.js` (`kerfjs/html` subpath, KF-333 — the `html` tagged template)
- `dist/html.d.ts`
- `dist/testing.js` (`kerfjs/testing` subpath)
- `dist/testing.d.ts`
- `dist/chunk-*.js` — shared chunks emitted by tsup's code splitting. Both entries import their shared modules (`SafeHtml`, the store registry, etc.) from these chunks so each module-level value exists exactly once at runtime. Do not import directly; consumers always go through the named entry points.
- Source maps for everything

`tsup.config.ts` runs with `splitting: true` (KF-14 / KF-15) — without it, esbuild bundles each entry independently, which both duplicates shared classes (breaking `instanceof` checks across entries) and tree-shakes shared module-level state into broken stubs.

The five entries (`index`, `jsx-runtime`, `testing`, `array-signal`, `html`) each emit a tiny shim that re-exports from one of the shared chunks; the bulk of the runtime lives in those chunks. That keeps the cross-bundle brand symbols (`Symbol.for('kerfjs.SafeHtml')`, `Symbol.for('kerfjs.ArraySignal')`) addressing exactly one class identity per kerf copy.

Runtime dep (`@preact/signals-core`) is external — consumers' bundlers pick it up from their own `node_modules`.

## Where to look for X

| If you're touching... | look in |
| --- | --- |
| Adding a new public export | `src/index.ts` + the relevant module + `docs/8-api-reference.md` — a function export's documented signature is then gated by `scripts/check-doc-api-signatures.mjs` (names + arity + return type vs the emitted `.d.ts`) |
| JSX attribute alias | `src/utils/jsx-attr-aliases.ts` (the `ATTR_ALIASES` map) |
| morph conventions | `src/morph.ts` (public `morph()` (KF-150), key matching, `data-morph-skip`, `data-morph-skip-children` (KF-152), `data-morph-preserve` (KF-151), focus preservation), `src/mount.ts` (segment dispatch) |
| SVG namespace handling | `src/toElement.ts` (`SVG_FRAGMENT_TAGS`) |
| Store reset semantics | `src/store.ts` (`REGISTRY`, `resetAllStores`) |
| Delegation tier docs | `docs/5-event-delegation.md` |
| Test coverage thresholds | `vitest.config.ts` |
| Release flow / version bumping | `scripts/release.sh` (release notes drafted via gitgist) |
| Commit-message drafting | `npm run commit:msg` → `gitgist --staged --commit-message` (gitgist is a devDependency) |
| GitHub Pages live-demo deploy | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` + `examples/reactivity-demo/vite.config.ts` (`base: '/kerf/demo/'`) + `site/astro.config.mjs` (`base: '/kerf'`) + `docs/9-live-demo.md` |
| Benchmark harness / perf numbers | `bench/` (`bench/README.md` + `setup.sh` / `run.sh` / `results.sh` / `aggregate-results.mjs` are the LOCAL dev-only harness → gitignored `results.local.*`). PUBLISHED numbers come from `bench/import-krausest.mjs` (KF-291), which fetches the official upstream krausest results and writes the git-tracked `bench/results.json` + `results.md`; homepage's `site/src/components/PerfTable.astro` imports `bench/results.json` — refresh by re-running the importer and committing. |
| Migrating hub (`/kerf/migrating/`) | `docs/10-migrating.md` (design doc) + `site/src/content/docs/migrating/{index.mdx,react.md,alpine.md,lit.md,vanjs.md}` (rendered pages) — KF-132 + KF-156/157/158/159 |
| Drop-in AI-tool config | `kerf.cursorrules` + `kerf.claude-skill.md` at repo root (source of truth) — both are hand-maintained condensations of `docs/ai/usage-guide.md`. KF-215 ships generated mirrors inside the npm package at `ai/skill.md` / `ai/cursorrules` / `ai/manifest.json`; regenerate via `npm run ai-bundle:sync`; design + canonical-file contract in `docs/12-ai-assistant-configs.md` |
